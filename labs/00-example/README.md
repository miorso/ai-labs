# Lab 00: Welcome to AI Labs!

## Overview

Welcome! This is your introduction to the AI Labs workshop system. Before diving into AI concepts, let's familiarize ourselves with how these labs work.

## Lab Structure

Each lab follows the same structure:

```
lab-name/
├── README.md        # Instructions and objectives (you're reading this!)
├── exercise/        # Your starting point with TODOs
│   └── main.ts
└── solution/        # Reference solution (try not to peek!)
    └── main.ts
```

## How to Work Through Labs

### 1. Start the Interactive Runner

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This launches an interactive menu where you can:

- 🔍 Search and filter exercises by typing
- 📖 View README instructions before each lab
- ✅ Run exercises with automatic `.env` loading

### 2. Complete the Exercise

1. The README is displayed before the exercise runs
2. Open `exercise/main.ts` in your editor
3. Look for `TODO` comments - these are your tasks
4. Complete each TODO to make the exercise work
5. Save your changes

### 3. Test Your Work

After completing the TODOs, use the action menu:

- **Run this exercise again** - Test your changes
- **Select a different exercise** - Move to another lab
- **Exit** - Quit when you're done

### 4. Compare with Solution

If you get stuck or want to see one approach, check `solution/main.ts`. But try to solve it yourself first!

## Your First Task

In this lab, you'll complete a simple welcome message. It's straightforward by design - the goal is to get comfortable with the workflow.

**Steps:**

1. Open `exercise/main.ts`
2. Find the TODOs
3. Replace the `???` placeholders with actual values
4. Run the exercise and see your welcome message!

## Tips for Future Labs

- Read the entire README before starting
- Complete TODOs in order
- Run the exercise frequently to test your progress
- Experiment! Change things and see what happens
- The solution is just one approach - yours might differ

Ready? Let's begin! Open `exercise/main.ts` and complete the TODOs.
